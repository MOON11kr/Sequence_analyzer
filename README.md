Sequence Analyzer is a Python package designed to analyze and process sequences such as DNA, RNA, protein, and numerical sequences. It provides powerful functions for sequence statistics, pattern recognition, similarity analysis, and transformation operations.

Installation
Install the package via pip:
pip install sequence-analyzer

 Usage:
You can use sequence_analyzer for various types of sequence analysis. Below are some examples:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Checking if a sequence is valid
python
Copy
Edit
from sequence_analyzer import is_valid_dna

sequence = "ATCGTAGC"
print(is_valid_dna(sequence))  # Output: True


2Ô∏è‚É£ Counting nucleotide occurrences
python
Copy
Edit
from sequence_analyzer import count_nucleotides

sequence = "ATCGATCG"
print(count_nucleotides(sequence))  
# Output: {'A': 2, 'T': 2, 'C': 2, 'G': 2}


3Ô∏è‚É£ Finding GC Content (%)
python
Copy
Edit
from sequence_analyzer import gc_content

sequence = "ATGCGC"
print(gc_content(sequence))  
# Output: 50.0

4Ô∏è‚É£ Reverse Complement of a DNA Sequence
python
Copy
Edit
from sequence_analyzer import reverse_complement

sequence = "ATCG"
print(reverse_complement(sequence))  
# Output: 'CGAT'


5Ô∏è‚É£ Finding a Pattern in a Sequence
python
Copy
Edit
from sequence_analyzer import find_pattern

sequence = "ATCGATCGATCG"
pattern = "TCG"
print(find_pattern(sequence, pattern))  
# Output: [1, 5, 9]


6Ô∏è‚É£ Translating a DNA sequence to Protein
python
Copy
Edit
from sequence_analyzer import translate_dna
sequence = "ATGTTTGGG"
print(translate_dna(sequence))  
# Output: 'MFG'
